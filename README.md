# Forked Learn — gamified CS, Python & JavaScript learning

React 19 + TypeScript + Vite + React Router + Framer Motion, with **Supabase** (auth + Postgres) for accounts and
cloud-saved progress. Deployed as a static SPA on **Vercel**.

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env     # fill in the two Supabase values
npm run dev              # http://localhost:5173
npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm run build
```

## Environment variables (Vercel → Project → Settings → Environment Variables, and local `.env`)

| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` | Supabase → Project Settings → API → **Project URL** |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Supabase → Project Settings → API → **Publishable** (or legacy **anon**) key |

Both are public by design. **Never** put the `service_role` / secret key in a `VITE_*` variable. Vite reads variables at
build time, so redeploy after changing them. Without them the app shows a "not configured" screen instead of crashing.

## One-time Supabase setup

1. **Database** — SQL Editor → run [`supabase/schema.sql`](supabase/schema.sql). It is idempotent and non-destructive: creates
   `profiles` / `game_states` if missing, enables Row Level Security (each user can only read/write their own rows), and adds a
   trigger that creates the profile (keeping the name typed at signup) when an account is created.
2. **Redirect URLs** — Authentication → URL Configuration:
   - **Site URL**: your production URL, e.g. `https://your-app.vercel.app`
   - **Redirect URLs** (add all): `https://your-app.vercel.app/**`, `http://localhost:5173/**`, and, if you use preview
     deployments, `https://*-your-team.vercel.app/**`
3. **Email** — Authentication → Providers → Email: keep *Confirm email* on if you want confirmation. (Supabase's built-in
   mailer is rate-limited; configure custom SMTP for real traffic.)
4. **GitHub** — create an OAuth App at github.com/settings/developers; *Authorization callback URL* =
   `https://<project-ref>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`. Paste Client ID/Secret into Authentication → Providers → GitHub and enable it.
5. **Google** — Google Cloud Console → APIs & Services → Credentials → *OAuth client ID* (Web application); *Authorized
   redirect URI* = `https://<project-ref>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`. Paste Client ID/Secret into Authentication → Providers →
   Google and enable it (configure the OAuth consent screen first).

## How it works

- `src/store/auth.tsx` — the single source of truth for auth: `loading | authenticated | unauthenticated`, derived only from
  `supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange`. Routes never redirect while `loading` (this is what fixes OAuth-return and refresh bounces).
- `src/layouts/AuthLayout.tsx` — `GuestOnly` / `RequireAuth` guards; post-login destinations are validated as same-site paths.
- `/auth/callback` handles OAuth and email-confirmation returns; `/reset-password` handles recovery links (PKCE flow).
- `src/store/game.tsx` + `src/services/progress.ts` — progress is keyed **per user**; loads from the cloud, keeps a per-user local
  backup, saves debounced with retry/backoff, merges before saving so a stale device can't overwrite newer progress, and wipes the
  local copy on logout once the cloud has the data.
- `src/store/engine.ts` — the XP / level / quest economy as pure functions (XP is derived, never stored).
- `vercel.json` — SPA fallback so `/app/...` deep links and refreshes work, plus security headers and a CSP.

## Not built yet (shown honestly as "Coming soon" in the UI)
Code Playground, Challenge Arena, Project Workshop, Leaderboard, Global search, Flashcards, Analytics, Code comparison.
Settings for sound, language, and reminder/summary notifications save a preference only; the features arrive later.

## AI Bot (dashboard assistant)

Chat + image generation inside the dashboard (`/app`, and full screen at `/app/assistant`). Code lives in `src/components/bot/`, `src/store/useBot.ts` and `src/services/{botApi,imageGen,intent}.ts`.

### Environment variables (URLs only)
| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `VITE_API_BASE_URL` | Chat backend base URL. The bot calls `POST {base}/chat` and `POST {base}/chat/clear`. |
| `VITE_IMAGE_WORKER_URL` | Cloudflare Worker URL for image generation. If empty, the bot works as chat only (Image mode is disabled). |

These are bundled into the browser, so they must never contain tokens. `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` and `CLOUDFLARE_IMAGE_MODEL` (default `@cf/black-forest-labs/flux-2-klein-4b`) belong **only** to the Worker (`wrangler secret put CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`). The Worker/backend must allow this app's origin in CORS.
`vercel.json` CSP allows `*.vercel.app` and `*.workers.dev` in `connect-src`; add your own domain there if you use a custom one.

### Contracts
- **Chat:** `POST {base}/chat` with JSON `{ message, sessionId }` (or `multipart/form-data` with `files`) → `{ success, data: { response } }` (markdown). Every request carries `Authorization: Bearer <Supabase access token>`.
- **Image Worker:** `POST {worker}` with JSON `{ prompt, width, height, references?: dataURL[], sessionId }` and the same Bearer token → either `image/*` bytes, or `{ success: true, data: { imageUrl } }` / `{ success: true, data: { imageBase64, mimeType? } }`. The Worker must verify the token, rate-limit per user, re-validate size (256–1920 px) and references (≤ 4), and map the request to the Workers AI model call.

## v0.3: AI Bot page, streaming, Code Lab, file reading, Arabic

### Where things live
| Page | Route | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| AI Bot | `/app/assistant` | The only place the bot exists (the dashboard home only links to it). |
| Code Lab | `/app/code` | Python + JavaScript editor and runner. Lazy-loaded. |

### Live streaming (backend contract)
The client calls the same `POST {VITE_API_BASE_URL}/chat` with the header `Accept: text/event-stream`. Backward compatible:
- **Backend streams** (`text/event-stream`, `application/x-ndjson` or chunked `text/plain`) → tokens appear live.
- **Older backend** (`application/json` → `{ success, data: { response } }`) → the answer is revealed progressively on the client.

SSE payloads may be raw text or JSON: `{ delta | token | text | content | response }`, OpenAI `choices[0].delta.content`,
Anthropic `content_block_delta`. End with `data: [DONE]` (or `event: done`); report failures with `event: error` + `data: {"message": "..."}`.
Minimal Express sketch:
```js
app.post('/api/chat', async (req, res) => {
  if (!String(req.headers.accept).includes('text/event-stream')) return res.json({ success: true, data: { response: await answer(req.body.message) } })
  res.set({ 'Content-Type': 'text/event-stream', 'Cache-Control': 'no-cache, no-transform', Connection: 'keep-alive', 'X-Accel-Buffering': 'no' })
  for await (const token of streamAnswer(req.body.message)) res.write(`data: ${JSON.stringify({ delta: token })}\n\n`)
  res.write('data: [DONE]\n\n'); res.end()
})
```
Make sure your proxy/CDN does not buffer the response (Nginx: `proxy_buffering off`).

### File reading in the bot
Code, text, config, data files and Jupyter notebooks are read **in the browser** and inlined into the message as fenced code blocks, so any backend receives
them (limits in `src/services/fileReader.ts`: 8 files, 80k chars/file, 200k chars total). Images are validated, downscaled to 2048 px when large and sent as multipart `files`.
Drag & drop and pasting screenshots work too. Binary files are rejected with a clear message.

### Code Lab
CodeMirror 6 editor. JavaScript runs in a throw-away Web Worker (no DOM/cookies, killed on Stop or after 15 s). Python runs with **Pyodide 0.29.4** (CPython in WebAssembly) in a Web Worker,
loaded from jsDelivr on first use (about 10 MB, then cached). `input()` reads the **Input** tab. Nothing is sent to a server. `vercel.json` CSP was widened accordingly
(`'wasm-unsafe-eval'`, `cdn.jsdelivr.net` for scripts/connect, `worker-src blob:`). To self-host Pyodide, change `INDEX` in `src/lab/python.worker.ts`.

### Arabic
Language switch: Settings, the topbar button (ع / EN) and the landing/auth headers. It sets `lang`/`dir` on `<html>` and persists in `localStorage` (`quest.lang`).
Strings are translated through `t('English text')`; the dictionary is `src/i18n/ar.ts` (missing entries fall back to English). RTL fixes are in `src/styles/rtl.css`.
**Fonts:** add your two files to `public/fonts/` (see `public/fonts/README.txt`). Arabic mode uses only those two families.
Lesson body text (the long explanations, quiz questions) is still English; titles, UI and curriculum metadata are Arabic.

### After pulling these changes
```bash
npm install   # adds CodeMirror packages and refreshes package-lock.json
npm run build
```
